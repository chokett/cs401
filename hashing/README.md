# Password Hashing
The following files were downloaded from the [password_compat project](https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat).

* password_compat/*

I recommend that you clone (aka download) the files directly from the respository to ensure that you have the latest version. This example is for demonstration purposes only. 

## Cloning on webdev
In your main website directory, execute
```
git clone https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat.git
```

Then include in the necessary PHP files using

```php
require_once('password_compat/lib/password.php');
```
